Project Utility FunctionsThis project is structured to demonstrate the creation of small, reusable utility functions and their corresponding unit tests using the Jest testing framework.Project StructureThe project has a simple, logical directory structure to separate the source code from the test files..
├── src/
│   └── utils.js
└── tests/
    └── utils.test.js
src/: This directory contains the source code for the utility functions.tests/: This directory holds the unit tests for the functions. It mirrors the src directory to make it easy to find the tests for a specific file (e.g., tests/utils.test.js tests the code in src/utils.js).Setup and Running TestsTo run the tests for this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system.Install Jest: If you haven't already, install Jest as a development dependency.npm install --save-dev jest
Configure package.json: Add a script to your package.json file to easily run the tests."scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
Run the tests: Execute the test script from your terminal.npm test
Jest will automatically find all files ending with .test.js within the tests directory (or any directory) and run the tests, providing a summary of the results in your terminal.
